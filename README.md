# SpotifyAdFreePlayer
 
This is a program that uses selenium-wire to block certain web requests that trigger Spotify ads.

# Important

Your antivirus may block the site from loading due to an invalid certificate chain. To fix this, double click the `ca.crt` file and install it to the `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` store.
When running the `adfreeplayer.exe` file, make sure you are running the exe file in the same directory as the other files.

# Prerequisites

You must have logged into open.spotify.com through Google Chrome.
